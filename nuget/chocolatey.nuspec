    <summary>Chocolatey is your machine level NuGet repository. Think apt-get for Windows (executables/application packages), not library packages.</summary>
    <description>Chocolatey - think executables/application packages (like apt-get for Windows), not library packages. This is what the Chocolatey NuGet goodness is for.
Chocolatey allows you to install application nuggets and run executables from anywhere.
======= Executable Nuggets =======
For example, say you have an executable in the tools folder of your package named bob.exe. Then you can type
'chocolatey install yourPackageName [-source source] [-version version]' OR 'cinst yourPackageName [-source source] [-version version]'
and when it finishes you can type
'bob'
and it will run your application executable.
======= Application Nuggets =======
Full on double rainbow. For example, say you type
'chocolatey install 7zip [-source source] [-version version]' OR 'cinst 7zip [-source source] [-version version]'
- when it finishes you will have installed 7zip on your machine (in your add/remove programs).
